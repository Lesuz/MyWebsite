                            <p>
                                I made a simple task list app with React Native as part of a hands-on practical test. Tasks can be 
                                added and deleted, and there is a bottom tab navigation with settings, manual, contact information and about page.
                            </p>
                            
                        </div>
                        <div class="howdididoit">
                            <h2>How I did it.</h2>
                            <p>
                                Requirements were: log in and sign up, pages, navigation and a good and easy layout with a color combination. Log in and sign up are missing on my app 
                                because I decided to focus more on the function of the app for what is was meant for. 
                            <p>
                                I started by sketching out my idea of how the app should look like. I tried to take into account what I had learned in previous hands-on practises. 
                                After this I made a cleaner version with figma and also made a prototype of it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                First I did the task list so that I would at least have that if I would not have the time to finish the rest of the app. After the task list worked with all of 
                                it functions, I added the bottom tab navigation and simply put the content of the other pages into them. 
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="whathaveilearned">
                            <h2>What I learned.</h2>
                            <p>
                                i learned how to make a navigation in React Native. I had done some navigation before this but I never understood how it worked. It turned out it 
                                is quite simple. Making a tab navigation was also new to me since I had previously only done stack navigation. Before this hands-on practical test I 
                                did not understand anything about react native, it did not help that most tutorials assumed that there was a knowledge about react as a base. After this task 
                                I feel more comfortable with react native but I do still have a lot to learn.
