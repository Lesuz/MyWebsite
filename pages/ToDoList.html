                            <p>
                                I made a simple To Do - list application that is running on the web.
                                This project is a part of my JavaScript course at school and the point 
                                was to get used to use JavaScript with HTML and Css, all in separate files. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The user can input their task, how important it is and when it has to be done. 
                                The input fields also have input validation, so no empty tasks can be added 
                                into the task list. 
                            </p>
                            
                        </div>
                        <div class="howdididoit">
                            <h2>How I did it.</h2>
                            <p>
                                The requirements for this project were: native JavaScript, DOM Scripting and Forms were 
                                to be used and it had to be deployed to could. I used Netlify. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                First I sketched out my idea on paper and thought about how I should begin 
                                doing this project. I started by doing the UI without functions, the UI 
                                changed a lot during this part. I chose the colors by looking up color 
                                themes and picking out a theme I liked. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Next I added the JavaScript to the project. My first goal was to make the "Add" - button to work. 
                                I wrote a basic script for getting the values of the input fiels and printed them into the console 
                                which was triggered by pressing the button. After this my goal was for the same function to add a 
                                table with fields for the data. At this point I am not yet adding the gotten values into the table.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now I had to put the gotten values into the right fields which was quite easy. The only problem I 
                                got at this point was that the fields were all different sizes depending on what was in them. To 
                                fix it I had to go set widths for the fields.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="whathaveilearned">
                            <h2>What I learned.</h2>
                            <p>
                                I learned how to link a javascript and css file to the html and how to add tags and css in javascript.
                                Most of this project was just brushing up things I had learned on my first year in school. Because of 
                                this project I felt confident enought to try and build this portfolio website.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="whatwouldichange">
                            <h2>What would I change.</h2>
                            <p>
                                First of all I would make it responsive. I plan on making another to do list application that is 
                                responsive and much better. I would make it look more modern, so that means a sleek design but simple.
                                It would also use storage so it can be used as an app. This one is missing it because it was not a 
                                requirement and we learned about it after this project had to be done.
