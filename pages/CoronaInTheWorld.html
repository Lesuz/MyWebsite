                            <h2>What I did.</h2>
                            <p>
                                I made a web application that shows how many cases in total a country has and how many 
                                the same country has had cases in each month. It uses the Covid 19 API. The user only need to input the 
                                name of the country and the web app does the rest.
                            </p>
                            
                        </div>
                        <div class="howdididoit">
                            <h2>How I did it.</h2>
                            <p>
                                The requirements for this project were: to use an API, to use AJAX to ask for the data, no external libraries 
                                allowed, event handlers should be added dynamically and it had to be deployed to Netlify.
                            <p>
                                First I build the UI to see what the web app could look like. I started by laying in flat colors which can still 
                                be seen if the website is reload in a fast speed. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Next I added the JavaScript to the project and added the AJAX call to get the data from the COVID 19 API. I tested out 
                                how the AJAX call works in the browsers console first to get a grip of it before I started to mess around with my code.
                                I took the date of the user's computer and input it to the string that gets the specific data to get the most recent data. 
                                I aso used substring to get the specific amount of cases for every month.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I added the background picture at the last minute because the website felt like it was missing something.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="whathaveilearned">
                            <h2>What I learned.</h2>
                            <p>
                                I learned how to use an API. I have never used one before and it was much easier than I had previously thought. I also 
                                learned to use substring and I was surprised I had not learned about it before. I felt more comfortable using html and css in this 
                                project since it is my third one in a short time. 
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="whatwouldichange">
                            <h2>What would I change.</h2>
                            <p>
                                I would make the website responsive and I am working on that, I just didn't have time to learn how to make it responsive 
                                in such a short time since the due date came so fast. I would probably also add more informatio on how the corona is in the world. This 
                                change is inspired by a classmate who also did this project using this API.
