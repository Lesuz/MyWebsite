                            <h2>What I did.</h2>
                            <p>This small project was part of a course of making applications with python. 
                               This was one of the first "bigger" projects in that course which combined some 
                               of the things I ahd learned in smaller bits. My goal was to make a calculator-like 
                               application that works and I succeeded. It might not look the best but this one mostly a 
                               introductional course for python.
                            </p>
                            
                        </div>

                            <h2>How I did it.</h2>
                            <p>
                                I used tkinter for this project. Tkinter was new to me but not hard to use. Sometimes I 
                                had problems to make the app look like I wanted. For example the buttons would not line up 
                                or the numbers in the buttons would all look different. I also used simple colors to 
                                differentiate numbers from the other buttons. 
                            </p>

                        <div class="whathaveilearned">
                            <h2>What I learned.</h2>
                            <p>
                                I learned how to make a python application that runs in a window. I learned how to use tkinter 
                                for a simple UI. I also learned to stylize buttons, change fonts, font sizes, padding and 
                                other decorational stuff using tkinter.
                            </p>

                            <h2>What would I change.</h2>
                            <p>
                                I would make the app look more modern. I don't know how I could to it with only using python or if it is even 
                                possible to use anything else for it. I would also add the previous answer onto the upper line, so the user 
                                can use that value if needed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I would leave a lot more comments in the code, since I checked and there are none and I am not sure why 
                                I did not comment since I usually do.
